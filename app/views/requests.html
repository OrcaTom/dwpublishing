      <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Request a change to GOV.UK</h1>
      <p>Make a request to change content on GOV.UK if you've:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
      	<li>seen something that's factually wrong</li>
      	<li>evidence that the user experience isn't satisfactory, eg direct user feedback</li>
      	<li>found a genuine user need for content that isn't already on GOV.UK and the user need <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition/govuk-proposition">should be met on GOV.UK</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't make a GOV.UK content request if you:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
      	<li>don't agree with the way something is written</li>
      	<li>think content should be moved on GOV.UK</li>
      	<li>are repeating content that can be found elsewhere on the internet</li>
      	<li>want to put up information that's only for people working in DWP</li>
      	<li>are doing it for purely business reasons, eg removing a phone number to stop calls and not giving an alternative</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">How to make a request</h2>
      <p>If you think your request is valid email Keith Prust (keith.prust@dwp.gsi.gov.uk) or, if the content is to do with a digital service, Tom Adams (tomadams.digitalDWP@gmail.com).</p>
      	<p>Explain the need you've found and give any evidence or data you have that people need the change to be made.</p>
         <p style="font-weight:700">Put any request for changes in as soon as possible. Allow 28 days for small changes to existing content, eg adding a sentence to an existing page, and 6 to 8 weeks for more complicated requests involving creating brand new pages on GOV.UK.</p>
      	<p>Don't include suggestions for how content should be written or 'signed off' content. A content designer will be given your request and will decide what content is needed.</p> 
      <h2 class="heading-medium">Campaign content</h2>
        <p>Speak to Gillian Hudson, Strategic Communications Directorate Head of Digital, about options for digital campaign content, including:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>use of social media</li>
          <li>getting a campaign page on GOV.UK</li>
        </ul>
