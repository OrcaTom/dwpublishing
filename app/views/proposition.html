      <p>The Government Digital Service (GDS) manages GOV.UK and is solely responsible for how information is presented on the website.</p>
      <p>The GDS content team designs pages based on user insight and web analytics to meet user needs.</p>
 
<p>Departments are responsible for checking the content is factually accurate - not for the words used on the page.</p>

 
<p>GDS will send us draft web pages to check before they are published. When we ask GDS to correct the page, we need to tell them the fact that users will need to know. GDS will draft the content to meet the GOV.UK style guide and send us the draft page to check.</p>
